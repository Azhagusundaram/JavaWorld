Print the shortest duration between the time values given in the input array. The time values are given in the format (hour:minute:second). 
The time values in the array are in no particular order.
Example:
Input : (12:34:55,1:12:13.8:12:15}
output:
4:22:40
Explanation:
12:34:55 8:12:15= 4:22:40
12:34:55 1:12:13 11:22:42
8:12:15-1:12:13-7:0:02 smallest is 4:22:40

Input Format:
The first line of the input consists of an integer, N that corresponds to the number of durations in the input array.
The next N lines of the input corresponds to the durations in a given array. Assume that the duration are given in the format: hours:minutes:seconds
Output Format:
Output is to display the shortest time duration (in hours:minutes:seconds) of all values in a given array Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications.
