My task was to implement “Chess Tournament” in which they gave four modules. implementation of 
all four modules are important. Given the number of players we have to conduct matches in pair we 
have to create a random method for match if ‘player 1’ wins gave 1 point else gave it to ‘player 2’ if 
there is a Tie then both ‘player 1 ‘ and ‘player 2’ got 0.5 point if number of players are odd then the last 
one gets bonus point 1 we have to display the winner of each match with both player at every round we 
have to display score of every player, and we have to assign match according to there score and once 
two player played a match they are not allowed to play match in the same pair we have to display the 
winner of the “Chess Tournament” and also the cumulative score (bonus points are not allowed to add).
